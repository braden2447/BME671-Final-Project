    "The aim of this project is to construct an algorithm that will take in raw sleep EEG data as an input, clean up and transform the data, and quantify the amount of time spent in each specific cycle of sleep. This is a signficant task because sleep analysis is used to gauge quality of sleep depending on the number of hours spent in certain sleep stages. We plan to clean the raw EEG data using certain filtering techniques explored in lab, and we will identify specific sleep stage signals based on their dominant frequency ranges."
